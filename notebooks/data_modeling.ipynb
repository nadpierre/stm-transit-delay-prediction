    "- `hist_avg_delay` Historical average delay is the second most important predictor. This aligns well with time series predictability since past delays often indicate patterns or bottlenecks that repeat over time.\n",
    "- `stop_location_group` This is also highly influential. Grouping the stops by location might be capturing specific problematic areas or geographic patterns that contribute to delays (e.g., heavy traffic zones, construction areas, major intersections).\n",
    "- `temperature_2m`, `wind_direction_10m` Weather conditions do play a role, but not as heavily as trip-related features. The fact that wind direction and temperature are relatively impactful suggests weather variability might affect delays more than just precipitation alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Least Important Features:**\n",
    "- `is_peak_hour` This is surprisingly less impactful than expected. It suggests that perhaps peak hours are not as unpredictable as other features.\n",
    "- `time_of_day_morning`, `time_of_day_night` Evening seems to be more influential than morning or night, which could indicate evening rush hour impacts.\n",
    "- `frequency_very_frequent` The bus frequency is contributing to the prediction. More frequent buses might be less susceptible to delays since missed connections or unexpected traffic issues don't accumulate as much.\n",
    "- `wheelchair_boarding` Very low importance, indicating it has minimal influence on delays.\n",
    "- `schedule_relationship_Scheduled` This has almost no impact, which might indicate that deviations from scheduled times are not systematically captured by the model."
